          As an investor, understanding the specifics of a merger agreement is crucial, especially 
          when deciding how much we will receive for each of our stocks, when the merger agreement is 
          scheduled to complete, and the conditions that must be satisfied for the merger to succeed or fail. 
          To that end, we intend to optimize large language models (LLMs) in order to grasp the facts of merger 
          agreements properly.<br><br>
        
          Our technique comprises evaluating different OpenAI LLMs, including but not limited to ChatGPT-3.5, Davinci, 
          and ChatGPT-4, in order to determine the best successful model for analyzing merger and acquisition related documents. 
          To determine which combinations generate the greatest results, we will explore several prompt techniques, such as zero 
          shot and multiple shot, as well as other LLM parameters, such as temperature and tokens.<br><br>
        
          When attempting to acquire desired outputs from LLMs, it is critical to realize that certain methods of prompting are 
          more effective than others. As a result, we will test several prompts to determine the most effective method for 
          appropriately assessing merger agreements. By doing so, we hope to guarantee that investors have access to the most 
          complete and accurate information available when making key investment decisions.<br>
